                <p>Munnar rises as three mountain streams merge - Mudrapuzha, Nallathanni and Kundala. 1,600 m above sea
                    level, this hill station was once the summer resort of the erstwhile British Government in South
                    India. One of the most sought after honeymoon destinations in Kerala, Munnar is replete with resorts
                    and logding facilities that fit a wide rage of budgets. Sprawling tea plantations, picturesque
                    towns, winding lanes and holiday facilities make this a popular resort town. Among the exotic flora
                    found in the forests and grasslands here is the Neelakurinji. This flower which bathes the hills in
                    blue once in every twelve years, will bloom next in 2030. Munnar also has the highest peak in South
                    India, Anamudi, which towers over 2,695 m. <br>

                    Let us now explore some of the options in and around Munnar that would provide travellers ample
                    opportunities to enjoy the captivating hill station of Munnar.</p>

                <h2>Eravikulam National Park</h2>

                <p>One of the main attractions near Munnar is the Eravikulam National Park. This park is famous for its
                    endangered inhabitant - the Nilgiri Tahr. Spread over an area of 97 sq. km., this park is also home
                    to several species of rare butterflies, animals and birds. A great place for trekking, the park
                    offers a magnificent view of the tea plantations caressed by blankets of mists. The park becomes a
                    hot destination when the hill slopes here get covered in a carpet of blue, resulting from the
                    flowering of the Neelakurinji. It is a plant endemic to this part of the Western Ghats which blooms
                    once in twelve years. </p>
