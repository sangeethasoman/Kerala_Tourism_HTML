                <p>Around 16 km to the south of northernmost district in Kerala, Kasaragod, lies the
                    massive Bekal Fort. It is among the biggest forts in Kerala and has been impeccably maintained
                    throughout the years. It rises to 130 feet above sea level and is situated on a headland spanning
                    35km. Much effort has been put to develop a beautiful beach here called the Bekal Fort Beach. People
                    flock to these spots in great numbers. Situated comfortably on steep hills by the sea, the fort
                    provides for an imposing view from the beach. Built using laterite slabs and with a polygonal shape,
                    it is amongst the most visited sites in Kerala.<br>
                    <br>
                    There are many factors that have added to the popularity of the site. An observation tower fitted
                    with beautiful peepholes, the Anjaneya Temple with its famous masonry and two Theyyam sculptures
                    built from laterite are among the primary attractions. An ancient mosque built by Tipu Sultan and
                    various underground passageways are also important places in the area. A rock garden was built using
                    laterite in the parking area and is an architectural marvel in itself. Trees have been planted on
                    the beach along with the construction of a splendid walkway which makes it easier to traverse the
                    beach and enjoy its sights. At night, the entire place is lit up with special lights that add a
                    whole new dimension to its beauty.<br>
                    <br>
                    Bekal Fort is about 68 km from Mangalore and 15 km from Kasaragod. If Indian history, historical
                    structures and natural beauty fascinate you, a trip to Bekal Fort will leave you mesmerised. Hereâ€™s
                    some information about Bekal Fort timings, entry fees and more to help you plan your trip better.
