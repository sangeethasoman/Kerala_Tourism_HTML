                <p>Aralam Wildlife Sanctuary is the northernmost wildlife sanctuary of Kerala, southwest India. It is 55
                    kmÂ² in area and located on the western slope of the Western Ghats. It was established in 1984 with
                    its headquarters near Iritty. Aralam Wildlife Sanctuary is situated in the southeast part of Kannur
                    District.Spread over a 55 sq. km area of forests on the Western Ghats, the Aralam Wildlife Sanctuary
                    is among
                    the finest of its kind in Kerala. It plays host to an exotic array of flora and fauna and is among
                    the most picturesque locations in Kannur district. The entire area is covered in tropical and
                    semi-evergreen forests and is a truly riveting sight.<br>
                    <br>
                    One can catch sight of herds of elephants, gaur, sambar, spotted deer, barking deer, Nilgiri Langur,
                    Hanuman Langur and the Malabar Giant Squirrel. It is also famous for the vast amount of butterfly
                    species found here. Most of these are endemic to the Western Ghats. The forest is peaceful and many
                    trekking options are available as well.<br>
                    <br>
                    Aralam village itself houses the famous Central State Farm, a government of India initiative built
                    in 1971. This is one of the main production centres of hybrid coconut seeds in the country. A visit
                    to the sanctuary is incomplete without visiting the great Katti Betta, the tallest peak in the area,
                    which is 1145 high. <br>
                    <br>
                    Day visit to the sanctuary is the standard activity here, but the place also offers
                    interestingly trekking opportunities like trek to Ambalappara, or to Meenmutty falls.
                    Ambalappara trek is over three days where overnight stay will be at Ambalappara watchtower.
                    The Meenmutty is a one-day package and you will be taking to the waterfalls in a jeep along
                    with a guide.
